        "# Ejercicio: Crear tu propio chatbot para consultar archivos PDF\n",
        "\n",
        "Objetivo:\n",
        "Crear un chatbot que sea capaz de responder preguntas basadas en el contenido de archivos PDF ubicados en una carpeta. Implementar diferentes métodos de chunking para optimizar el proceso de consulta. Además, experimentar con la idea de trabajar en formato markdown. Por último, agregar la funcionalidad de chat_history para mantener una conversación fluida.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instrucciones:\n",
        "* Carga de archivos PDF: Trabajar con una carpeta de archivos que tenga al menos un archivo en formato PDF.\n",
        "Utiliza herramientas como PyMuPDF, pdfplumber, o pypdf2 para extraer el texto de los archivos PDF.\n",
        "* Procesamiento del texto con chunking: Explora diferentes estrategias de chunking para dividir el texto extraído en partes más manejables para el modelo:\n",
        " * Chunking basado en párrafos.\n",
        " * Chunking basado en número de tokens.\n",
        " * Chunking basado en líneas.\n",
        "* Implementación del chatbot: Utiliza LangChain para crear el pipeline del chatbot. Usa el módulo DocumentLoader de LangChain para cargar los archivos PDF y procesarlos. Experimenta con los diferentes métodos de chunking para evaluar cuál da mejores resultados en términos de coherencia de las respuestas.\n",
        "* Agregar chat_history: Una vez que tu chatbot esté funcionando correctamente, añade la funcionalidad de chat_history. Esto te permitirá mantener el contexto de la conversación para que el chatbot pueda referirse a preguntas anteriores en las respuestas actuales. Usa el módulo ConversationChain de LangChain para gestionar el historial de la conversación.\n",
